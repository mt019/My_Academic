## [A Study on the Air Pollution Control Fee and Its “Assessment Period”](R10A21126.pdf)

In the current financial revenue system, special levies are a type of non-tax levy. Among these, those intended for environmental regulation and protection are categorized as environmental special levies. As distinct types of levies, non-tax special levies differ from taxes in terms of the legal norms they are based on and the mechanisms for budgetary oversight of their revenue. The characterization of certain environmental levies as special levies rather than taxes is not without controversy. Moreover, there is a need for further refinement of the legal norms related to the environmental levies currently imposed in practice. This paper focuses on environmental levies, taking the "Air Pollution Control Fee" as an example, and specifically addresses the "Fixed Pollution Source Air Pollution Control Fee." It reviews the Air Pollution Control Act and its charging methods, examines the practicality and rationality of the period for retroactively paying air pollution fees, and finally attempts to propose some expectations for improving the relevant legal norms.
