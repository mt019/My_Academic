## [A Study on the Air Pollution Control Fund System in Taiwan](R10A21126.pdf)

This paper focuses on the Air Pollution Control Fund and explores the Special Income Fund system of non-operational special funds. By analyzing its principles of application, financial sources, purposes, and other aspects, it seeks to understand the current legal disputes and institutional challenges it faces. The paper first summarizes the nature of air pollution control fees and the controversies surrounding the Air Pollution Fund as a special fund. It then analyzes the financial sources and purposes of the Air Pollution Fund, pointing out corresponding relationships and inadequacies. The paper argues that air pollution fees should be levied as designated use taxes and comply with the principles of legal reservation and the polluter-pays principle. In principle, government existing revenues or treasury subsidies should be excluded from the Air Pollution Fund, ensuring a corresponding relationship between its financial sources and purposes. Based on a review of the current regulatory system, the paper concludes by proposing possible models and suggesting directions for future reforms of the Air Pollution Fund.
