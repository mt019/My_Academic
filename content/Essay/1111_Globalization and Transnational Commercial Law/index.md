## [The Challenges and Prospects of International Tax Governance in the Globalized Era](R10A21126.pdf)


This paper reviews the literature and identifies the relationship between the tax system and state sovereignty, especially in the age of globalization. The paper also tries to sort out the interaction between taxation and international commercial activities. In addition, the paper provides an outlook on the coming development of the international tax system. It calls for a multi-level and multilateral international tax regime that provides a friendly and stable environment for globalized economic transactions, contributes to net-zero carbon emissions, and maintains the tax base for governments around the world to achieve tax justice.
